I'm still new to this whole coding thing, but I'll give it my best effort to explain what I know. 
Conventions and syntax are like boxes within the code that contain information in Unity.
You have your main mono box and inside that box are your class boxes and inside those boxes are function boxes. 
You must use curly brackets to complete your box and a semi colen to end sentences. 
That's about the basis of what I know.
