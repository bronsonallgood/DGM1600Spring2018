Switch Statements are used like if then else if statements
but rather then having the program run the entire list 
it will just run the list until it finds what it needs to then stops (or breaks).
void Start () {
	switch (UserName)
	{
		case "Password";
			print("Password is correct.");
			break;

		case "LevelUp":
			print("You win!!");
			break;

		case "Black Panther":
			print("Made over 200 million this weekend!");
			break;
		
			default:
			print("Why don't you just tell me what movie you want to watch");
			break;

		case "Cats":
			print("Cats aren't so great");
			break;

		case "Dogs":
			print("Dogs are much better");
			break;
 
		case "Video Games":
			print("Video games are alright.");
			break;

		case "Movies":
			print("Scott Pilgrim vs The World is a good movie!");
			break;
