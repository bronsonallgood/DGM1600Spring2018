Foreach Loops are written like the english language, but very simplified to a point where you're using
four words to describe what you want the code to do.
You'd write what system you want it from first, 
then specify exactly what box
which then follows up with the word in specifying the other box you'd what the information from.
foreach (var player in Players)
